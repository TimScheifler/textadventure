            <h2>Storyline</h2>
            In the game, the player is a squirrel that lives in
            a tree which is in the garden of the family Dreyfus. Since squirrels do not hibernate but put on
            some layers to still be able to go outside, they
            need at least a small supply of food so that they
            do not have to move out of the nest in colder
            days.
            However, something bad happened a few days
            ago. While the squirrel was looking for food one
            night, a marten got hold of the squirrel's stored
            food and took it with him. Since the squirrel is
            out of stock now and it is very cold outside, the
            squirrel has to go out every day to avoid starving.
            There are three places where food can be
            found.<br>
            The bird house, in the compost or in the forest.
            Every place keeps danger at hand to which the
            squirrel has to react to.
            In order not to be robbed again, the squirrel
            must go home at sunset!

            <h2>Game Explanation</h2>
            <h3>The nest</h3>
            <p>
                    The nest is the spawn point and safe space of
                    the player. It always offers protection to the
                    player. If it is too dangerous to leave the nest,
                    the player should spend some time in the nest
                    and wait until the danger is over. However, the
                    player must leave the nest daily to get some
                    food.
            </p>
            <h3>The garden</h3>
            <p>The garden is the main area of the game and
                    must be crossed daily since the playerâ€™s nest is
                    on a tree right in the middle of the garden. The
                    tree offers a great view of all activities in the garden. The bird house, the compost and Stella the
                    cat are always in view. The player must always
                    keep an eye on Stella, because she likes to eat
                    squirrels and is also spending a lot of time in the
                    garden.
            </p>
            <h3>The forest</h3>
            <p>The forest is an area full of opportunities. It offers many hiding places such as bushes or little caves in the ground or a variety of food like
                    spruce cones or nuts. Many predators such as
                    martens, owls, buzzards and foxes live in it as
                    well. The player must try to avoid them to stay
                    alive. This area is always worth checking out
                    since it offers a variety of different events every
                    day. These events are randomised daily. It is
                    planned to implement at least 10 different event
                    lines such as talking to other squirrels to finish
                    some small quests, finding random food drops
                    or running from a hungry fox.
