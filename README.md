# A SQUIRRELS ADVENTURE

I am very excited to create this text adventure
since I have never created something similar.
The whole project is going to be a tough challenge since I don’t have any JavaScript Experience and only some experience with HTLM,
CSS and JSON. However, I am sure that this
challenge will help me to learn many new techniques and tools that could be useful in the future.


## Storyline
In the game, the player is a squirrel that lives in
a tree which is in the garden of the family Dreyfus. Since squirrels do not hibernate but put on
some layers to still be able to go outside, they
need at least a small supply of food so that they
do not have to move out of the nest in colder
days.
However, something bad happened a few days
ago. While the squirrel was looking for food one
night, a marten got hold of the squirrel's stored
food and took it with him. Since the squirrel is
out of stock now and it is very cold outside, the
squirrel has to go out every day to avoid starving.
There are three places where food can be
found.<br>
The bird house, in the compost or in the forest.
Every place keeps danger at hand to which the
squirrel has to react to.
In order not to be robbed again, the squirrel
must go home at sunset!

## Game Explanation
The goal of the player is to
act correctly in different situations and to stay
alive for as many days as possible. The player
must collect food at different spots. There are
going to be easy ways of finding food like finding
random food in the forest or digging for hidden
food supplies. But there are also going to be
some more challenging food spots where the
player could risk his life by running into a predator. It is always recommended to avoid risks as
much as possible. However, risky food spots
might be even more rewarding then normal
ones. Especially at hard times.
It is up to the player to play safely or occasionally take risky decisions that may pay off. There
are going to be three main areas in the game
that the player can explore at any time during the day.

### The nest:
   The nest is the spawn point and safe space of
   the player. It always offers protection to the
   player. If it is too dangerous to leave the nest,
   the player should spend some time in the nest
   and wait until the danger is over. However, the
   player must leave the nest daily to get some
   food.
### The garden:
   The garden is the main area of the game and
   must be crossed daily since the player’s nest is
   on a tree right in the middle of the garden. The
   tree offers a great view of all activities in the garden. The bird house, the compost and Stella the
   cat are always in view. The player must always
   keep an eye on Stella, because she likes to eat
   squirrels and is also spending a lot of time in the
   garden.
### The forest:
   The forest is an area full of opportunities. It offers many hiding places such as bushes or little
   caves in the ground or a variety of food like
   spruce cones or nuts. Many predators such as
   martens, owls, buzzards and foxes live in it as
   well. The player must try to avoid them to stay
   alive. This area is always worth checking out
   since it offers a variety of different events every
   day. These events are randomised daily. It is
   planned to implement at least 10 different event
   lines such as talking to other squirrels to finish
   some small quests, finding random food drops
   or running from a hungry fox.
