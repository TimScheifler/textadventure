Squirrel text adventure game

##Storyline
In the game, the player is a squirrel that lives in
a tree which is in the garden of the family Dreyfus. Since squirrels do not hibernate but put on
some layers to still be able to go outside, they
need at least a small supply of food so that they
do not have to move out of the nest in colder
days.
However, something bad happened a few days
ago. While the squirrel was looking for food one
night, a marten got hold of the squirrel's stored
food and took it with him. Since the squirrel is
out of stock now and it is very cold outside, the
squirrel has to go out every day to avoid starving.
There are three places where food can be
found.<br>
The bird house, in the compost or in the forest.
Every place keeps danger at hand to which the
squirrel has to react to.
In order not to be robbed again, the squirrel
must go home at sunset!

##Game Explanation
The goal of the player is to
act correctly in different situations and to stay
alive for as many days as possible. The player
must collect food at different spots. There are
going to be easy ways of finding food like finding
random food in the forest or digging for hidden
food supplies. But there are also going to be
some more challenging food spots where the
player could risk his life by running into a predator. It is always recommended to avoid risks as
much as possible. However, risky food spots
might be even more rewarding then normal
ones. Especially at hard times.
It is up to the player to play safely or occasionally take risky decisions that may pay off. There
are going to be three main areas in the game
that the player can explore at any time during the day.
